                                    <p>Lovely month, Had pretty rough time with some people in initials of the month, made me reflect how do i treat relations in life but whatever it is have made peace with it, Whatsoever it is. Learnings, Unlearnings & Relearnings.</p>
                                    <p>Man Exams are so handsfree this time, that's the least thing i think aboout during the entire semester and I'm scoring way better than the avg (A's Level) and that's super weird for me, as i struggled with it pretty much for 2 years of my life.</p>
                                    <p>Confidence Building be going well too, am able to have better approach techniques at stuff and can actually get stuff done super calmly where all these things matter</p>
                                    <p>Obsessing over an Idea of Daily Newspaper revolution lately, working on it. But gotta keep my min(Placement) prep ongoing to keep myself secure</p>

                                    <p>First Day of College, pretty epic</p>
                                    <p>Leaving Home was the toughest thing to ever do, seeing the neighbour hood go away where i did so many things made me sad</p>
                                    <p>But back to college, took me like 24 hours door to door but was fun. Good talking on the trip.</p>
                                    <p>Had a magical convesation in the train at night. This happens rarely but it was truly amazing. I felt amazing and it was like heart warming. I hope i know more about this person as time passes, its really interesting and she is fascinating.</p>
                                    <p>Too many seniors in the train, got to know about placements and all so that also added up.</p>
                                    <p>Skipped first day of class to get a course which i didn't get initially, got it nevertheless. Gave laddoos, felt really happy. Real stuff starts tomorrow. Everything is now set</p>

                                    <p>It's the other part of year now, Half Year Review</p>
                                    <p>Man 2024s aging, it's the other part of year now. The summers were thought provoking. I finally got the RAWness what i was looking forward to in life. Thanks to Summers legit</p>
                                    <p>The first part of year started pretty rough man, felt pretty distracted always whenever i checked my phone, always felt left out of place. Took a lot of friction to understand things. It's pretty important to understand the way you treat the next person, it's not compulsory that the next person will also treat you the same. whatever you do for them, they won't reciprocate it back</p>
                                    <p>The academics and learning part was decent, nothing to write about it. It just went straight forward as it goes regularl</p>
                                    <p>Now, its 3rd Year m8. This year has got the most effort to reward ratio, so i have to embrace myself for that. because i'm here to do something, to have an impact</p>
                                    <p>Also my maladaptive day dreaming has to stop. It drains me out always whenever i do it.</p>

                                    <p>This time i have got 8.5 credits of C grade all super unexpected!!. By 1 mark lost them!!!. DBMS lost A by 2 marks and Sensors by 3 marks and all were because of DAs.</p>
                                    <p>I still have no idea what is happening with my life here. Whatever i do i just can't help it. The CGPA still lies at 8.20 which increased by 0.01 this time. I mean *sarcastic laugh* I have nothing to say.</p>
                                    <p>Today morning the pain was a lot man, it was legit equivalent to something like a heartbreak. The body just pauses and implodes. I hope i recover from this, gotta do something.</p>

                                    <p>Dance just makes you happy what i observed from practice and makes you feel good about yourself. I liked it, I will rock the dance floor hehehehe.</p>
