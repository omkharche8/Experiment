    <p>First Day of College, pretty epic</p>
    <p>Leaving Home was the toughest thing to ever do, seeing the neighbour hood go away where i did so many things made me sad</p>
    <p>But back to college, took me like 24 hours door to door but was fun. Good talking on the trip.</p>
    <p>Had a magical convesation in the train at night. This happens rarely but it was truly amazing. I felt amazing and it was like heart warming. I hope i know more about this person as time passes, its really interesting and she is fascinating.</p>
    <p>Too many seniors in the train, got to know about placements and all so that also added up.</p>
    <p>Skipped first day of class to get a course which i didn't get initially, got it nevertheless. Gave laddoos, felt really happy. Real stuff starts tomorrow. Everything is now set</p>
