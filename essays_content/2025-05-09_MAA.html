        Write your main blog content below this comment.
        You can use standard HTML tags such as:
        <p>Paragraphs for your text.</p>
        <p class="essay-title-section">New sections or subheadings.</p>
        <h3>Smaller subheadings (or styled paragraphs).</h3>
        <ul><li>For bulleted lists.</li></ul>
        <ol><li>For numbered lists.</li></ol>
        <strong>For important text (bold).</strong>
        <em>For emphasized text (italic).</em>
        <a href="https://example.com">Links to other pages.</a>
        
        If you want to use the special text style (slightly larger, theme-colored),
        you can add the class "custom-text" to any <p> or <div> element,
        and ensure its definition is in styles.css:
        <p class="custom-text">This paragraph will use the custom style.</p>

    <p>"Smart people respond, dumb people react."

        Simplest quote ever to exist but was one of the most impactful quotes I've ever read & tried on implementing in my life.
        In the last 6 months, i feel i have actually gained around 3 years of avg(human-life) experience.
    </p>

    <p>Understanding myself has always been the goal for me, the more I understand myself, the better decsions i take in life upto now
        & it's working, i see it happening.

    <p class="essay-title-section">The Big Decision</p>
    <p>The previous blogs will tell a story that i am going for college placements, and that was true until i had a breakdown around November thinking about what am i doing with my life, i wasn't able to code the way 
        i wanted to even after 6 months of intensity, this is the problem, so i took a stop to think about what am i doing. The truthful answer was follow the same thought-process i had since 6th grade, do something creative.
        <br>
        <p>I am starting a shoe company, yes I am starting a total shoe brand which is going to compete with the likes of Skechers, comet, allbirds etc. It will be global since day1 (trying to)
            can't share more details here until i launch it. Launch will be in 2026, will update more as life proceeds.
        </p>
    </p>
    <p class="essay-title-section">Will write here monthly</p>
    <p>buying this name.com domain has got me super exciting, i would love to document more things as i have my own path to chase now. It's excitng, scary yet ambitious.</p>
