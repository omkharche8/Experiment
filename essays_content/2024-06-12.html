    <p>WTF is wrong with me???!!!!</p>
    <p>Bruh this is the 4th time i'm seeing my GPA and feeling what do i even lack in life.</p>
    <p>This time i have got 8.5 credits of C grade all super unexpected!!. By 1 mark lost them!!!. DBMS lost A by 2 marks and Sensors by 3 marks and all were because of DAs.</p>
    <p>I still have no idea what is happening with my life here. Whatever i do i just can't help it. The CGPA still lies at 8.20 which increased by 0.01 this time. I mean *sarcastic laugh* I have nothing to say.</p>
    <p>Today morning the pain was a lot man, it was legit equivalent to something like a heartbreak. The body just pauses and implodes. I hope i recover from this, gotta do something.</p>
