    <p>20th Year, Birthday Month Check</p>
    <p>Lovely month, Had pretty rough time with some people in initials of the month, made me reflect how do i treat relations in life but whatever it is have made peace with it, Whatsoever it is. Learnings, Unlearnings & Relearnings.</p>
    <p>Man Exams are so handsfree this time, that's the least thing i think aboout during the entire semester and I'm scoring way better than the avg (A's Level) and that's super weird for me, as i struggled with it pretty much for 2 years of my life.</p>
    <p>Confidence Building be going well too, am able to have better approach techniques at stuff and can actually get stuff done super calmly where all these things matter</p>
    <p>Obsessing over an Idea of Daily Newspaper revolution lately, working on it. But gotta keep my min(Placement) prep ongoing to keep myself secure</p>
