    <p>Half Year Review</p>
    <p>Man 2024s aging, it's the other part of year now. The summers were thought provoking. I finally got the RAWness what i was looking forward to in life. Thanks to Summers legit</p>
    <p>The first part of year started pretty rough man, felt pretty distracted always whenever i checked my phone, always felt left out of place. Took a lot of friction to understand things. It's pretty important to understand the way you treat the next person, it's not compulsory that the next person will also treat you the same. whatever you do for them, they won't reciprocate it back</p>
    <p>The academics and learning part was decent, nothing to write about it. It just went straight forward as it goes regularl</p>
    <p>Now, its 3rd Year m8. This year has got the most effort to reward ratio, so i have to embrace myself for that. because i'm here to do something, to have an impact</p>
    <p>Also my maladaptive day dreaming has to stop. It drains me out always whenever i do it.</p>
