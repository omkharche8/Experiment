<div class="essay-text">
    <p>My college life has been crazy for real, especially if i pause and think about it.</p>
    <p>i liked a girl, i talked with her, i asked her out, she said no, but we decided to be friends. We turned best friends forever. Priorities for both of us changed, life changed, she got closer to another set of friends & i started to feel anxious.<br> Frequent fights took place & one day it reached peak, where it was decided by her that we'll be aquaintances.    
    i was shaken, quite a lot, actually a lot. i lost the feeling of being happy again, the void in my heart grew as large it can get. I coudn't grow past the word "aquaintance". It felt like a dead end, i was even unfollowed from her socials to which i was attached the most.</p>
    <p>The story feels super normal from a distance & technically, you can just blame her & move on, woo another girl? & live a totally normal life, but that's not what i did</p>

    <p>I spent time in my room, experiencing all the emotions possible & documented them. Call me crazy, but i really wanted to get to the bottom of this. What did i make her feel? What does she think about me?</p>
    <p>I have a few answers, not on why it all happened, but how do i think about such situations now.</p>

    <h3>Choices</h3>
    <p>Life is about choices, you can be wrong or you can be right. There are many of these choices, you take together as friends which decide the future of your relationship. Being a 19 year old, the experimental nature of both our lives made us do things we regret later. So please, take all these things with a pinch of salt. Be super calm & composed, analyse a few things & make sure you won't repeat things which went wrong in the past.</p>
    
    <h3>Attachment & Detachment</h3>
    <p>Caring for someone & getting attached are two separate things. You shouldn't be attached to someone who lacks verbal commitment. Life moves on at all times & you will find yourself in dumps when the next person chases something you are not interested in. They are a different person, let them live & enjoy the friendship but don't make them feel bad for what they are doing, unless they ask.</p>
    
    <h3>Never hate them</h3>
    <p>No one is truly bad at heart. It's all situations which make people choose, wrong choices. But, every person comes in your life for a purpose. Let it happen & develop a habit of being compassionate towards them. </p>

    <h3>Growth</h3>
    <p>Everyone at any stage of life is growing. You are growing, they are growing. Believe in yourself that people who will stay while you are growing are your truest friends. You come alone & you die alone, such heartbreaks are just temporary speedbreakers in timeline of life. When something like this happens, take a step back, sleep over it & understand yourself. The universe always gives you what you want & you will get it.</p>

    <h3>Get educated at things</h3>
    <p>Search the web & Learn everything about love, relationships, spotting green & red flags, but you have to be the best partner to attract the best partner. Don't chase relationships, chase wisdom & compassion. Learn your attachment style & fix them for the better. Don't chase temporary dopamine. And when you understand all this, take things with a pinch of salt.</p>

    <p>I wish her all the love, all the success & i hope that she gets what she wants in her life. She was a very important person in my life, she helped me grow and she is the reason i can take up many risks now, so all i want to do is thank her for everything, I will always cherish her, good & positive vibes only.</p>
