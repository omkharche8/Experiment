    <p>Learning to Dance</p>
    <p>Yo I have a wedding coming up (My Sisters) in exactly a month from now. So everyone here is going to dance. Even I'm in it!.</p>
    <p>Learning to Dance is like the most different to learn skill for me. As i have never danced after 6th Grade (Stage Performance) getting those moves out my body is lil time taking but gotta do it.</p>
    <p>Dance just makes you happy what i observed from practice and makes you feel good about yourself. I liked it, I will rock the dance floor hehehehe.</p>
